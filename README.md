# Cavity-Resonators
-It's required to write a computer program that computes the quality factor of a
specific rectangular cavity resonator at its first 2 resonances. The program takes the
conductivity of the waveguide metal, relative permittivity and loss tangent of filling material (at
specific frequency), and the waveguide dimensions and gives out the resonance frequency,
resonance bandwidth and the quality factor of resonator at the first 2 resonances. Assume
b<a<d in your code.
